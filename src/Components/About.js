            Hi how are ya? Welcome to my blog where I talk about my love for the
            ourdoors, sustainability, fitness, tech, and anything else. Through
            my adventures outside, I noticed the large amount of pollution that
            plauge our natural parks and I want to make a difference. Through
            the power of my words and actavism within my community I hope I can
            teach my community and many more about the consequences of their
            actions.
